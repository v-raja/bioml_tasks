## Use Cases

Enzyme annotation is essential in various biological contexts, such as:

1. Functional genomics: Understanding the functional role of enzymes within an organism.
2. Metabolic engineering: Designing and optimizing metabolic pathways for the production of desired compounds.
3. Drug discovery: Identifying potential drug targets or enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs.
4. Comparative genomics: Comparing enzyme functions across different species to understand evolutionary relationships.

## Task Variants

Enzyme annotation tasks can vary based on:

1. Target organisms: Different organisms may have unique enzymes or enzyme families.
2. Enzyme classes: Enzyme annotation may focus on specific classes or families, such as kinases, proteases, or
   transferases.
3. Annotation level: The level of detail in the annotation, including EC number assignment, catalytic site prediction,
   or substrate specificity prediction.
