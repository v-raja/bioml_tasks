The design of promoter sequences is a key task in metabolic engineering, aimed at optimizing gene expression levels to
maximize product yields or improve cellular performance. Promoters are DNA sequences located upstream of a gene that
regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factors and RNA polymerase. The choice of a promoter sequence can
significantly influence the expression of a target gene, thus affecting the overall efficiency of the engineered
pathway.

# Use Cases

1. Enhancing the production of a specific metabolite by tuning the expression of pathway genes.
2. Engineering synthetic gene circuits for applications such as biosensors, logic gates, or genetic switches.
3. Balancing expression of multiple genes in a pathway to minimize metabolic burden and avoid toxicity.

# Machine Learning Tasks

## Expression level prediction

The base task of promoter sequence design involves training machine learning models on existing promoter sequences and
their corresponding gene expression levels. The input for the model is a promoter sequence, and the output is a
predicted gene expression level. Validation metrics for this task include accuracy_score, r_squared_score, and
mean_squared_error.

## Specificity prediction

ML models take input features and predict the specificity of the designed promoter to a particular target gene or group
of genes.
The predicted specificity can be used to minimize off-target effects and ensure precise control of gene expression.

## Orthogonality prediction

ML models take input features and predict the orthogonality of the designed promoter, which refers to the independence
of its activity from other promoters in the system. The predicted orthogonality can be used to design promoters that
function independently within complex genetic circuits.

## De novo promoter design

This task involves designing entirely new promoter sequences based on the desired expression levels and specific
regulatory requirements. Machine learning models may take as inputs parameters such as binding site preferences,
regulatory elements, and transcription factor profiles, and return optimal promoter sequences as outputs.

## Promoter library optimization

This task focuses on optimizing a pre-existing library of promoters with known expression levels. Machine learning
models can take as inputs the sequences and corresponding expression levels of these promoters and predict the
performance of new promoter variants.

## Other tasks

Other task variants might include optimizing promoter sequences for specific environmental conditions or designing
sequences with minimal off-target effects.
Further, genetic algorithms and other optimization techniques can be combined with machine learning models to explore
the vast
sequence space and identify optimal promoter sequences.

# Best Practices

- Ensure the training data represents the organism or system of interest
- Account for potential off-target effects when designing promoters
- Consider the stability and robustness of promoter sequences in the context of the organism or system being engineered
